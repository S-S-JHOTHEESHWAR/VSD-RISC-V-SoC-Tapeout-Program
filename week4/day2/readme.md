# 📘 Week 4 - Day 2: NMOS Characteristics Analysis using SPICE

## 🔍 Objective
- To analyze **NMOS transistor characteristics** using **SPICE simulation**.  
- Study the relationship between **drain current (ID)** and **drain-to-source voltage (VDS)** for different **gate-to-source voltages (VGS)**.  
- Examine how **ID varies with VGS** for a fixed **VDS**.

## ⚙️ Device Parameters
- **Width (W)** = 39 µm  
- **Length (L)** = 15 µm  

## 🧩 Key Plots
- **ID vs VDS** → To observe the **linear and saturation regions** of NMOS operation.  
- **ID vs VGS** → To understand **threshold voltage** and **transistor conduction behavior**.

## 🧠 Summary
These simulations help visualize how the **NMOS transistor responds to voltage variations**, providing insight into **current flow, channel formation, and device performance** under different biasing conditions.
