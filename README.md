### ⚙️ Week 2 – RVMYTH Integration & VSDBabySoC Simulation

> “From TL-Verilog to Waves — the BabySoC finally comes alive!”

This week marked a major milestone in the **VSD SoC journey**, transforming design files into a living, breathing SoC.

- 🧠 **RVMYTH Conversion:** Translated the **`rvmyth.tlv`** (TL-Verilog) file into synthesizable **`rvmyth.v`**, enabling smooth integration with the SoC environment.  
- 🧩 **Integration:** Combined the **RVMYTH core**, **PLL**, and **10-bit DAC** to form the complete **VSDBabySoC**.  
- 🧪 **Simulation:** Compiled and simulated the SoC using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** for functional verification.  
- 🌊 **Waveform Analysis:** Visualized the output signals in **GTKWave**, confirming proper communication between the processor core, PLL, and DAC modules.  
- 🔍 **Key Insights:** Observed stable clock generation by the PLL, verified RISC-V instruction execution, and confirmed DAC response — bridging digital and analog domains.

> 🚀 **System in Motion:** The BabySoC officially boots into life — running RISC-V instructions, syncing clocks, and pulsing analog outputs.  
> The silicon dream is now **digital reality**.


## 🙏 Gratitude & Acknowledgment
