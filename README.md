# VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program

Repository containing my work for the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, documenting the end-to-end journey of learning to build a RISC-V based SoC.

## 📅 Weekly Progress

### Week 0 – Getting Started with SoC & Tools Installation
- Installed required tools (e.g., **Yosys**, **iverilog**, **gtkwave**, **ngspice**, etc.).
- Set up the working environment on Ubuntu.
- Understood the basics of SoC design flow: Specification → RTL design → Functional Verification → Synthesis → SoC Integration → Floorplanning → Placement → CTS → Routing → GDSII generation → DRC/LVS checks → Fabrication (Tapeout → Tapein).

## 🙏 Acknowledgment  

I am thankful to **Kunal Ghosh** sir and the **VSD (VLSI System Design) team** for organizing the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program free of cost.
