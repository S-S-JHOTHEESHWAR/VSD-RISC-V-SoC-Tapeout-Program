2. Learn about **Inferred Latches in Verilog** and why they should be avoided.  
3. Explore the role of **For Loops in Verilog**.  
4. Use **Generate Blocks in Verilog** for scalable design.  
5. Introduction to **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** in digital logic.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. If-Else Statements in Verilog

- If-Else is used to describe **conditional logic**.  
- Synthesizers map nested If-Else to **priority encoders**.  
- For parallel conditions, use **Case statements** instead (optimized for hardware).  

Example:
```verilog
always @(*) begin
  if (sel == 2'b00) y = a;
  else if (sel == 2'b01) y = b;
  else if (sel == 2'b10) y = c;
  else                  y = d;
end
```

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Inferred Latches in Verilog

* A latch is inferred when not all conditions of a combinational block are specified.
* This causes unintended storage, which is usually **undesirable in synthesis**.

Example (bad):

```verilog
always @(*) begin
  if (enable)
    q = d;   // No else â†’ synthesizer infers a latch
end
```

âœ… Fix by covering all branches:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
  if (enable)
    q = d;
  else
    q = 0;
end
```

## ðŸ”¹ 3. For Loops in Verilog

* **For loops in synthesizable Verilog are unrolled** during synthesis.
* They are useful for repetitive hardware structures like adders, shifters, and multiplexers.
* Loops must have **static limits** known at compile time.

Example:

```verilog
integer i;
always @(*) begin
  sum = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1)
    sum = sum + data[i];
end
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Generate Blocks in Verilog

* `generate` allows **parametric and scalable hardware instantiation**.
* Often used to replicate modules or logic based on a parameter.

Example:

```verilog
genvar i;
generate
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin : adder_array
    full_adder fa (.a(a[i]), .b(b[i]), .cin(c[i]), .sum(s[i]), .cout(c[i+1]));
  end
endgenerate
```

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)

* RCA is a basic form of binary adder built using **a chain of full adders**.
* Each adder waits for the carry-out of the previous stage â†’ hence the name *ripple*.
* Simple to design, but **slow for large bit-widths** due to carry propagation delay.



---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

* âœ… **If-Else** â†’ priority logic, use carefully (case preferred for parallel conditions).
* âœ… **Inferred Latches** â†’ result from incomplete assignments, avoid them.
* âœ… **For Loops** â†’ unrolled by synthesis, good for repetitive logic.
* âœ… **Generate Blocks** â†’ scalable, parameterized hardware instantiation.
* âœ… **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** â†’ simple but slow adder due to carry ripple delay.
